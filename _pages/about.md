I currently work at [Lucid Motors](https://lucidmotors.com/) as a Security Engineer, where I focus on identifying vulnerabilities in arm-based systems using static and dynamic analysis, crafting proof of concepts, and conducting threat analysis.

I graduated from [Arizona State University](https://asu.edu) in the summer of 2023 with a Master's degree in Computer Security. During my time at ASU, I was involved with [SEFCOM](https://sefcom.asu.edu/), primarily collaborating with [Dr. Tiffany Bao](https://www.tiffanybao.com/), as well as [Dr. Yan Shoshitaishvili](https://yancomm.net/), [Dr. Ruoyu (Fish) Wang](https://ruoyuwang.me/), and [Dr. Adam Doupe](https://adamdoupe.com/).

My research at ASU focused on automated vulnerability analysis in application software, with a particular emphasis on fuzzing and dynamic patching.

Before graduating from ASU, I interned at SEFCOM under Dr. Tiffany Bao.

I also participated in CTF competitions with [Shellphish](https://shellphish.net/), where I concentrated on challenges related to Web Security and Reverse Engineering. Prior to joining Shellphish, I was a core member of [Team bi0s](https://bi0s.in).
