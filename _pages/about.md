Iâ€™m a Computer Security Masters student at [Arizona State University](https://asu.edu). I currently work at [SEFCOM](https://sefcom.asu.edu/) primarily with [Dr. Tiffany Bao](https://www.tiffanybao.com/) and also with [Dr. Yan Shoshitaishvili](https://yancomm.net/), [Dr. Ruoyu (Fish) Wang](https://ruoyuwang.me/), and [Dr. Adam Doupe](https://adamdoupe.com/). 

My research focuses on automated vulnerability analysis on application software. My areas of interest include fuzzing, and dynamic patching. 

Prior to joining for Masters at ASU, I had interned at SEFCOM under Dr. Tiffany Bao. 

I play CTF's with [Shellphish](https://shellphish.net/) focussing on Web Security and Reverse Engineering based challenges. Prior to joining Shellphish, I was a core member of [Team bi0s](https://bi0s.in).
