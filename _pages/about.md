Hi, I’m Gokul Krishna. I’m a Computer Security Masters student at [Arizona State University](https://asu.edu). I currently work at [SEFCOM](https://sefcom.asu.edu/) primarily with [Dr. Tiffany Bao](https://www.tiffanybao.com/) and also with [Dr. Yan Shoshitaishvili](https://yancomm.net/), [Dr. Ruoyu (Fish) Wang](https://ruoyuwang.me/) and [Dr. Adam Doupe](https://adamdoupe.com/). 

My research focuses on automated vulnerability analysis on application softwares. My areas of interest include fuzzing, and dynamic patching. 

Prior to joining for Masters at ASU, I had interned at SEFCOM under Dr. Tiffany Bao. I am a CTF player currently with [Shellphish](https://shellphish.net/) focussing on Web Security challenges and occasionally Reverse Engineering based challenges as well. Prior to playing with Shellphish, I was a core member of [Team bi0s](https://bi0s.in).
