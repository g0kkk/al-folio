The [SignalHandler](https://github.com/g0kkk/SignalHandler) project is an implementation of signal handling in 32bit and 64bit assembly language. The project provides instructions on how to compile the code for both 32bit and 64bit systems using nasm and ld commands. To compile the code for a 32bit system, the user must use the "elf_i386" option and the "elf32" format flag. For a 64bit system, the user must use the "elf64" format flag. The compiled code can be executed by running the output file.
